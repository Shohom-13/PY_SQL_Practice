This project demonstrates how to connect Python to an SQLite database (sales_data.db), execute SQL queries to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue per product, and visualize the results using a simple bar chart with pandas and matplotlib. The database contains a single sales table with product names, quantities, and prices. The script connects to the database via sqlite3, runs a GROUP BY query to aggregate sales data, prints the summary in the terminal, and saves a revenue-by-product bar chart (sales_chart.png). This project is ideal for beginners to practice integrating SQL with Python for data analysis and visualization.
